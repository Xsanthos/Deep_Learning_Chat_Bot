# Deep_Learning_Chat_Bot

PRD (Project Requirement Document)

    Overview
      
      This is a chat bot, trained using data from famous social media. The bot uses parent-child comments
    from various posts submitted by real people all over the world. The chat bot operates by filtering the 
    database from offensive comments and then applying various algorithms to the database, which then enables
    the bot to analyze users' input questions and answer to them as humanely as possible.
    
      This project is due March 8th, which is the end of our second semester at the university. It will utilise 
    Python v3.8 and custom made libraries in order to achieve it's purpose.
